# Javascipt and classes

## OOP

## Object
- Collection of properties and methods
- example : toLowerCase

## why use OOP
-code was messed o chunk wased use thats why we need oop
-services and intances

## parts of OOP
object literal

- constructor function
    - gives new instance and new copy.
    - new keyword is used here
    - whenever we use new Keyword it makes new emppty object which is called instance
    - if new object is created 
    - constructor function is alled using new keyword
    - this keyword is injected in it
    - we got all in funciton

- prototypes (proto)
- Intances (new,this) 

## 4 pillars
- Abstraction
    - internals data are hide in this 

- Encapsulation
    - Encapsulation means keeping data safe from outside interference by restricting direct access.

- Inheritance
    - Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

- Polymorphism
    - Polymorphism means the same method behaves differently depending on the object calling it.
        - poly means many
        - morphism means ways
